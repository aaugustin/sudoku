SuDoKu solver and generator
===========================

This program is a command-line utility to resolve and generate SuDoKu grids.

Installation
------------

Run as root:
	$ make install

Usage
-----

To obtain detailed usage information, run:
	$ sudoku --help

When resolving a SuDoKu, the grid can be specified as an argument, on the
standard input, or in a file with the --input option. Known cells in the
grid are represented by the corresponding figure, empty cells by one these
characters: underscore, dash, space, dot, zero, and line breaks are ignored.
If there are several solutions to the grid, all of them are shown.

When generating a SuDoKu, no arguments are necessary. It is possible to
generate several grids at a time with the --count option.

If the --estimate option is set, an estimation of the difficulty of the grid
is printed. The estimation is a (float, int) pair and the figures are the
resulution time for a human and for a computer, respectively. Difficulty for
a human starts at 1 and is generally stays below 6, although no upper limit
is enforced. Difficulty for a computer is the number of resolution steps
required by the algorithm used in the program.

The output format in which the grids are displayed can be selected with the
--format option.

The --debug option is only available when using the Python implementation or
when the C implementation is compiled in debug mode.

Programmer API
--------------

Internally, a Python module called "sudoku" is defined. Both a pure Python and
an equivalent C implementation are available for this module. It contains two
objects: a SuDoKu class and a Contradiction exception. The sudoku module will
automatically import the best implementation available. Public methods of the
SuDoKu class are documented in sudoku/csudoku.py.
